Hello gamer!
This is text based game: BEAGLES
You have 10 tries to guess a number.
Number will consist of {MAX_NUMBERS} numbers. Example: 023 or 359
After each answer you'll receive a response. 
\tPIKO: One number is correct but in a wrong position.
\tFERMI: One number is correct and in a correct position.
\tBEAGLES: None of numbers are correct nor in a correct position.
Would you like to play?
